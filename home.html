				<h3>Asian Edition</h3>
				<p>The DXY to 90.92 highs in N.Y. on Friday, <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"></span>a seven-session peak, and up from overnight lows of 90.13. The Greenback reversed Thursday's losses, which came on the back of inflation fears, driven by surging Treasury yields. Since then, the market calmed some, with the USD advancing on those same higher yields. Incoming data was supportive, as personal income and consumption rose more than expected. The FX market remains uncertain on general USD direction going forward. Improving vaccine rollout may ultimately help the USD's fortune as the economy opens faster, though massive stimulus, while a boost for the economy, will ramp up inflation concerns, perhaps ultimately weighing on the Dollar.

				<h3>North American Edition</h3>
				<p>The dollar and yen rallied as a risk-off theme coursed through global markets,<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"></span> with equity markets, commodities, including base metals and oil, all tumbling. The sharp spike in U.S. and most other sovereign yields this week and the associated concerns about inflation have driven the correction in risk assets and currencies. We maintain that sovereign yields are lifting out of exceptionally low levels, that rising yields and interest rates are par for the course in major bull markets in equities by historic standards, and that the prospect of higher corporate earnings can still carry equities higher. But for now, the prevailing bias is a risk-off one, although Treasury yields have dropped back quite sharply from highs today. In the mix today has been news of a U.S. airstrike in Syria against infrastructure used by Iranian-backed militia, which was reportedly in response to recent Iranian attacks on U.S. interests in Iraq. The DXY dollar index rallied over 0.7% in posting an eight-day high at 90.77, while EUR-USD concurrently dropped to a four-day low at 1.2093. Cable plunged to eight-day lows under 1.3900. The Australian and New Zealand dollars underperformed, not surprisingly, having been outperformers during the risk-on times. AUD-USD dove over 1.5% in printing an eight-day low at 0.7731. USD-CAD lifted to a one-week peak at 1.2685, extending the sharp rebound out of yesterday's three-year low at 1.2466. The yen, meanwhile, has been the biggest loser gain, outperforming even the dollar so far today as its traditional role as a haven currency become re-established. USD-JPY dropped from a six-month high at 106.43 to a low at 105.86. Bitcoin has hit a low so far just above $44,000, which is nearly 15% down on yesterday's high and some 25% down on the record peak that was seen earlier in the week. Arguments by crypto advocates that bitcoin is a hedge against inflation have evidently been found wanting.

In the mix today has been news of a U.S. airstrike in Syria against infrastructure used by Iranian-backed militia, which was reportedly in response to recent Iranian attacks on U.S. interests in Iraq. The DXY dollar index rallied nearly 0.5% in posting a four-day high at 90.49, while EUR-USD concurrently dropped to a two-day low at 1.2129. Cable retreated back under 1.4000 on route to pegging an eight-day low at 1.3903. The Australian and New Zealand dollars underperformed, not surprisingly, having been outperformers during the risk-on times. AUD-USD fell over 0.5% in printing a one-week low at 0.7805. USD-CAD lifted to a four-day peak at 1.2649, extending the sharp rebound out of yesterday's three-year low at 1.2466. The yen, meanwhile, has been the biggest loser gain, outperforming even the dollar so far today as its traditional role as a haven currency become re-established. USD-JPY dropped from a six-month high at 106.43 to a low at 105.86. Yen crosses dropped sharply out of trend highs in synchrony, with AUD-JPY, for instance, diving some 2.5% from the three-year high the cross had seen yesterday. Over in the cryptocurrency world, sharp declines have made a return. Bitcoin has hit a low so far just above $44,000, which is nearly 15% down on yesterday's high and some 25% down on the record peak that was seen earlier in the week. Arguments by crypto advocates that bitcoin is a hedge against inflation have evidently been found wanting.
