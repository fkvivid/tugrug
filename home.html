				<p>The DXY to 90.92 highs in N.Y. on Friday, a seven-session peak, and up from overnight lows of 90.13. The Greenback reversed Thursday's losses, which came on the back of inflation fears, driven by surging Treasury yields. Since then, the market calmed some, with the USD advancing on those same higher yields. Incoming data was supportive, as personal income and consumption rose more than expected. The FX market remains uncertain on general USD direction going forward. Improving vaccine rollout may ultimately help the USD's fortune as the economy opens faster, though massive stimulus, while a boost for the economy, will ramp up inflation concerns, perhaps ultimately weighing on the Dollar.
